# AWT

## A brief description of the technology
Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) is a well known Java framework for creating graphical user interfaces.

## Reason(s) why this technology is an appropriate possibility for this project
* well documented and tested
* familiar to many students/maintainers
* relatively easy to learn
* implemented using the Java language (which is the language used in this project)

AWT is a part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes, which makes it a trusted choice for creating graphical user interfaces. Because it's backed by Oracle, there is adequate documentation for maintainers to reference.
